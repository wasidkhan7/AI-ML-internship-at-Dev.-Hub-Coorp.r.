# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

## 🛠️ Solution
We used Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to predict the target (heart disease: 1 or 0). The dataset was explored, cleaned, visualized, and split into training and testing sets.

## 📦 Model Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

## 📊 Results & Findings
- Accuracy: ~98% (Decision Tree)
- ROC Curve shows good class separation
- Most important features: `cp`, `thalach`, `oldpeak`

## 📚 Skills Gained
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve

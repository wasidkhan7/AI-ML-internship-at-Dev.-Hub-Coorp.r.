# Task 4: General Health Query Chatbot

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Create a chatbot that can answer general health-related questions using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## 🛠️ Solution
We used the `distilgpt2` model from Hugging Face. The model wasn't fine-tuned but used prompt engineering to simulate conversational responses for basic health queries like "What causes fever?" or "Is paracetamol safe for children?"

## 📦 Model Used
- `distilgpt2` (Pretrained, Prompt-Based)

## 🗨️ Prompt Format
You are a helpful medical assistant. User: <question> Assistant:


## 🧪 Results & Findings
- Response quality depends on prompt strength
- Effective for simple questions
- Not suitable for deep or critical medical advice

## 📚 Skills Gained
- Prompt Engineering
- Using Transformers for Language Modeling
- Conversation Formatting

## Note: I used gistilgpt2 transformer model which is free, lightweight and used for small tasks, so its result might not be accurate and not useful in real life
